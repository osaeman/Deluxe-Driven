          We regularly review and update our privacy policy. This version was

        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure we provide you with the best possible service, it is
          important that the personal data we hold about you remains accurate

        <h3>The data we collect about you</h3>
        <p>
          Personal data, also referred to as personal information, is any data
          that can be used to identify an individual. This does not include
          anonymous data where identity-related details have been removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect, use, store, and transfer different types of personal data,
          categorized as follows:

          Additionally, we may collect, use, and share Aggregated Data, such as
          statistical or demographic insights, for analytical purposes. While
          this data may be derived from personal data, it does not reveal your
          identity. If aggregated data is combined with personal data in a way
          that could identify you, it will be treated in accordance with this
          privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data, including

          sexual orientation, health, genetic or biometric data, trade union
          membership, or criminal records.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>If you fail to provide personal data</h3>
        <p>
          Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a
          contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when
          requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are
          trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods
          or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service
          you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the
          time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <p>
          We are committed to offering you choices regarding the use of your
          personal data, particularly concerning marketing and advertising. You
          have the right to control how we communicate with you and can manage
          your preferences regarding promotional messages at any time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
        <p>
          We may utilize your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, and Profile
          Data to assess your preferences and determine which products,
          services, or offers may be of interest to you. This process enables us
          to tailor our marketing efforts to better suit your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will receive marketing communications from us if you have
          requested information or purchased goods or services from us and have
          not opted out of receiving such communications.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Opting out</h3>
        <p>
          You may request at any time that we or third parties cease sending you
          marketing communications by contacting us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that opting out of marketing messages will not affect the
          processing of personal data provided to us in connection with a
          product or service purchase, service experience, or other
          transactions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Change of purpose</h3>
        <p>
          We will only process your personal data for the purposes for which it
          was originally collected, unless we determine that an alternative use
          is necessary and compatible with the original purpose. If you would
          like an explanation regarding the compatibility of a new purpose with
          the original one, please contact us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we
          will inform you and provide details on the legal basis that permits
          such processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that, in certain circumstances, we may process your
          personal data without your knowledge or consent if required or
          permitted by law.
