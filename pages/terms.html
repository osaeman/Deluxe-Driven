        <p>
          Deluxe Driven reserves the right to amend these Terms and Conditions
          at any time for quality assurance and service enhancement. Any
          modifications will be reflected on the Deluxe Driven homepage, with a
          notice provided to users at least 14 days before the new Terms and
          Conditions take effect. By continuing to use our website, users
          acknowledge and agree to be bound by the updated terms unless they
          explicitly object. Furthermore, utilizing Deluxe Driven’s services
          constitutes acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For safety reasons and to minimize distractions for the chauffeur,

        </p>
        <p>
          Consumption of alcohol is not permitted in our vehicles. Any exception
          to this policy requires prior approval. The customer is fully

          Under no circumstances are drugs allowed in our vehicles. The

          passenger found under the influence of drugs. In such cases, no
          refunds will be issued, and the customer will be responsible for the
          full cost of the trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Deluxe Driven chauffeur services are pre-booked. As a result,
          vehicles may have subsequent reservations scheduled after the current
          trip. If additional time is required for hourly bookings, it is
          subject to the chauffeur’s discretion. To avoid any inconvenience,
          clients are advised to schedule extra hours in advance.

          <li>
            <b>Operator Responsibility and Compliance with Regulations</b>
            <p>
              Deluxe Driven Ltd operates in full compliance with Regulation
              9(14) of the Private Hire Vehicles (London) (Operators' Licences)
              Regulations 2000. As a licenced private hire operator, we assume
              full responsibility for accepting all bookings directly from
              passengers and for providing transportation services in connection
              with those bookings.
            </p>
            <p>
              This includes ensuring that all journeys are conducted in licenced
              private hire vehicles by licenced drivers, from the designated
              pick-up location to the agreed drop-off point, for the pre-agreed
              fare or an accurately estimated amount provided in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
              By making a booking with Deluxe Driven, passengers enter into a
              direct contractual agreement with us as the operator. We guarantee
              full accountability for the safe, reliable, and efficient
              provision of our services.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Children</b>
            <p>
              In London, private hire vehicles (PHVs) are exempt from the
              requirement to provide child seats. If a child seat is needed,
              passengers must request it in the comments section when making a
              booking and specify the child’s age, weight, and the type of seat
              required.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chauffeurs do not carry child seats in their vehicles due to space
              limitations. Deluxe Driven will provide a child seat free of
              charge if the chauffeur is located near our office where the seats
              are stored. However, in cases where the chauffeur must travel to
              our office to collect the child seat, an additional charge may
              apply. Passengers will be informed in advance before the chauffeur
              is dispatched for seat collection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The parent or guardian is solely responsible for supervising the
              child throughout the journey. The chauffeur reserves the right to
              cancel the ride if the child causes damage to the vehicle, creates
              a hazardous situation, or exhibits abusive behaviour towards the
              chauffeur.
            </p>
            <p>
              The minimum age to book a ride is 12 years. For passengers under
              18, a written declaration from a parent or guardian is required
              before travel.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Conveyance of Animals</b>
            <p>
              If a customer wishes to bring an animal on board, prior permission
              must be obtained before booking to ensure that Deluxe Driven and
              its partners are willing to accommodate such a request. Guide dogs
              will always be accepted and will not be refused. Deluxe Driven’s
              chauffeurs reserve the right to decline transportation of any
              animals (except for guide dogs) if prior approval was not granted.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Policy on Passengers and Luggage Assistance</b>
            <p>
              The luggage capacity and seating capacity for each vehicle are
              displayed in all vehicle illustrations. When booking through the
              Deluxe Driven website, any additional luggage beyond the stated
              capacity may incur an extra charge, subject to available space.
              Deluxe Driven reserves the right to refuse any luggage that was
              not pre-approved, does not fit within the vehicle’s boot, or
              compromises safety conditions. For health and safety reasons, only
              cabin-sized bags are permitted inside the passenger area of the
              vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
              For MPV vehicles, in accordance with Transport for London (TFL)
              regulations, the driver’s rearview mirror must remain unobstructed
              at all times. Excessive luggage in the luggage compartment that
              obstructs the rear window will not be permitted. Similarly,
              vehicle seating capacity is clearly stated. Any additional
              passengers beyond the agreed number at the time of booking may be
              refused if space is insufficient or if safety conditions are
              compromised.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Luggage Assistance</b>
            <p>
              As a courtesy, our chauffeurs are happy to assist passengers with
              loading and unloading their luggage. However, please be advised
              that if the destination is a multi-story house, apartment, or
              requires additional assistance, chauffeurs are not obligated to
              carry luggage to the door or handle extended luggage transit.
            </p>
            <p>
              If porter services or specialized luggage handling are required,
              passengers must request them at the time of booking or well in
              advance. Such services may be subject to additional charges.
              Arrangements for porter services can be made through our customer
              care team via phone or email.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Delays</b>
            <p>
              In cases of extreme weather conditions or other unavoidable
              circumstances, customers may be eligible for partial compensation,
              such as for extended waiting times. If a last-minute cancellation
              occurs due to unforeseen events, a full refund will be provided,
              subject to the customer's acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event of unexpected traffic delays, road blockages, or
              similar incidents beyond Deluxe Driven’s control that may result
              in financial losses—such as missing important meetings, hotel
              reservations, or flights—Deluxe Driven assumes no liability and
              will not provide compensation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Penalties caused due to customers</b>
            <p>
              Any penalties, including parking fines incurred due to the
              customer's actions or failure to obtain prior approval—such as for
              special parking arrangements required by building management—will
              be the sole responsibility of the customer and charged

              The Deluxe Driven fleet is equipped with dashcams to ensure the

              footage only, with the microphone function disabled to respect
              passenger privacy.

              If a customer prefers not to have their journey recorded, they

              the duration of the trip.

        <h3>Passenger no-show policy:</h3>
        <p>
          A "no-show" is defined as a situation where the passenger is
          uncontactable via call, SMS, or email. A no-show results in the
          cancellation of the customer's service for the booked period if they
          fail to arrive at the designated pickup location. However, this policy
          may be waived if the customer agrees to a later pickup time and
          notifies Deluxe Driven accordingly. Grace periods: Airport pickups: 90
          minutes Non-airport pickups: 30 minutes If the passenger fails to
          arrive within the specified timeframe, the chauffeur will be released,
          and the full booking cost will be charged.

                <p>
                  A no-show is defined as a situation where the customer fails
                  to arrive at the designated pickup location without prior
                  cancellation within 30 minutes after the scheduled pickup
                  time. In such cases, the full cost of the booked service will
                  be charged. However, additional waiting time charges will not
                  be applied where feasible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For airport and train station pickups, a no-show occurs if the
                  customer has not cancelled at least 60 minutes before the
                  scheduled pickup time. In these instances, the full service
                  fee remains payable, but no additional waiting time charges
                  will be incurred where possible.

                <p>
                  A no-show is defined as the customer failing to arrive at the
                  designated pickup location within the booked service hours at
                  the agreed time. In such cases, the full cost of the booking
                  remains payable. The chauffeur will wait for up to one hour,
                  regardless of the total booked duration, before departing and
                  classifying the booking as a no-show.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For airport and train station pickups, a no-show occurs if the
                  customer does not arrive within the booked service hours after
                  the agreed pickup time and location. The full service fee will
                  still be charged, and no additional waiting time costs will

                </b>
                <p>
                  Deluxe Driven actively monitors flight statuses to accommodate
                  delays and ensure timely pickups. However, in the event of a
                  flight delay or cancellation, the customer is responsible for
                  informing Deluxe Driven at the earliest opportunity.

        <h3>Flight Delay Policy</h3>
        <p>
          If your flight is delayed, we offer a grace period of up to 60 minutes
          at no extra charge. As our pricing policy outlines, additional waiting
          time will incur additional fees.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Daytime Flights (6 AM - 7 PM)</b>
            <p>
              Our chauffeurs manage multiple assignments based on a predefined
              schedule, and adjustments to one booking may impact their
              availability for other passengers. For flights arriving between
              6:00 AM and 7:00 PM, Deluxe Driven will monitor flight statuses
              and adjust the pickup time for delays or early arrivals within a
              90-minute window from the originally scheduled landing time.
              However, the final decision to wait remains at the discretion of
              management and the chauffeur.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a flight is delayed or arrives more than 90 minutes earlier or
              later than scheduled, the service will be classified as a
              "no-show," and standard no-show policies will apply. Should a
              decision be made to wait and apply waiting time charges, payment
              must be settled before the completion of the journey.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Nighttime Flights (7 PM - 6 AM)</b>
            <p>
              For flights arriving between 7:00 PM and 6:00 AM, if a flight is
              delayed or arrives early by 60 minutes or more without prior
              notification, the booking will be classified as a "no-show." In
              such cases, the pre-paid booking will be forfeited, and Deluxe
              Driven will attempt to arrange a new ride based on availability.
              The new booking will be charged at the current rate for the
              service, and payment must be settled before the ride is completed.

        <h3>Flight Cancellations:</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of a flight cancellation, the customer must notify Deluxe
          Driven at least four hours before the scheduled pickup time to avoid a
          "no-show" charge, which is equivalent to the full fare of the booked
          ride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failure to inform Deluxe Driven of a flight delay or cancellation,
          resulting in a "no-show," will lead to the customer being charged the
          full fare of the scheduled ride with no eligibility for a refund.

          charges based on the extra kilometers traveled.

            <p>
              For transfer services, the first 60 minutes of waiting time after
              the agreed pickup time is complimentary for airport pickups, while
              all other pickup locations include 15 minutes of free waiting
              time. Any additional waiting time beyond these complimentary
              periods will be charged per minute at a fixed rate. This rate will
              be determined based on the hourly booking price applicable to the
              pickup location and the selected vehicle category, inclusive of
              VAT.

            <b>Additional Kilometres for Hourly Booking</b>
            <p>
              Deluxe Driven and its partners operate with a fixed
              kilometer-per-hour rate. Any additional kilometers beyond the
              allocated hourly rate will be charged separately as extras. The
              cost will be calculated based on the hourly booking rate
              applicable to the agreed pickup location, including the vehicle
              category rate and VAT.

            <b>Terms of Payment and Transaction Fees</b>
            <p>
              The Customer may make payments using all major credit cards.
              Payment will be processed immediately upon completion of the
              booking, while any additional charges incurred during the journey
              will be debited within 24 to 48 hours after the trip concludes.

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Invoice</b>

              Invoices are sent to the user as soon as their journey is finished
              (only if no extras are added), including a review form that they
              can send back to us in email form or through our social media
              pages. Journeys, where the Customer has added extras, the invoice,
              and review form, will be sent within 24-48 hours after journey
              completion.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any charges resulting from currency conversion or transactions
              involving different local accounts shall be borne by the Customer.
              Additionally, if Deluxe Driven detects any suspicious activity,
              the Customer may be required to present the credit card used for
              payment along with a valid form of identification.

            <b>Refunds</b>
            <p>
              For any booking exceeding £250.00, a 2% credit card processing fee
              will be applied, as charged by our credit card processing
              provider. No reimbursement will be issued if the booking falls
              under the following conditions: cancellation occurs outside the
              permitted grace period outlined in our cancellation policy; the
              customer misses their scheduled flight, train, ferry, or any other
              mode of transport; or if the customer is unreachable via the
              contact details provided, in accordance with our standard waiting
              time policy.

            <b>Extra Charges</b>
            <p>
              For airport pickups, a complimentary waiting time of 60 minutes is
              provided, while for non-airport pickups, the free waiting period
              is limited to 15 minutes. Any deviations from the originally
              planned route or additional stops made during the journey will
              incur extra charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              For hourly bookings, extensions must be requested in advance, as
              approval is subject to the chauffeur’s availability and
              discretion. Any additional charges will be applied in accordance
              with the original booking details and our established terms and
              conditions.
